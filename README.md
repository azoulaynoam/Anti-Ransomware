# Anti-Ransomware
#### Old project of mine from High-School as I was studying cyber-security.
#### The year is 2016 and the Ransomware is pretty new and I've thought of a concept to aknowledging such processes.
#### * This project is not fully functional and was a POC only. *
#### Theoreticly:
      - Check every new process for file changes in a non-human way by time and folders
      - Boobitrap folders setup
